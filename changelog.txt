2025.1's already out, and so is the beta for 2025.4!
2025.1.1 and 2025.4 are the same release.

[bold]Version 2025.4_b3[end]

        - Fix strings in the build script
        - Add support for injecting commands.txt in the build script
        - Add support for injecting config.json in the build script
        - Show a faint marker on options that can't be executed yet

[bold]Version 2025.4_b2[end]
    - If a non-number is given for the [underline]/delay[end] command, the delay is set to 0.01s
    - Save changes before showing output/any delays for the [underline]/logout[end] command

            - You are already playing with a streamer.
            - The streamer's server is already full.
        - You can still use RoSniper to scan for server-hops in any case.
    - Removed the "How To Use" section in the Main Menu
    - Restart RoSniper when you erase a cookie from the JSON
