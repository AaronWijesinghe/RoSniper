2025.1's already out, and so is the beta for the minor 2025.1.1 release.
2025.1.1 SHOULDN'T break anything as only a few minor changes are present.
Expect an RC soon.

[BOLD]Version 2025.1.1_b1[END]
A few QoL improvements!
    - New command alias, [UNDERLINE]/help[END]
        - Functions the same as [UNDERLINE]/cmds[END]
    - New command, [UNDERLINE]/declineFirst[END] (alias [UNDERLINE]/df[END])
        - If a streamer is already playing when you run RoSniper, you won't join them.
        - This is a temporary value. When you are done sniping, the above function won't work unless you run the command again.
        - Potential use cases:
            - You're already trying to join someone.
            - You are already playing with a streamer.
            - The streamer's server is already full.
        - You can still use RoSniper to scan for server-hops in any case.
    - Removed the "How To Use" section in the Main Menu
