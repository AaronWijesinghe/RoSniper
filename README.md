# Ever wanted to join someone instantly on Roblox?
This is my attempt at achieving this.

# How does RoSniper work?
RoSniper uses Roblox's Presence API to check if they are online.
If so, then it will attempt to join that user.

# Current Features:
- Snipe users you recently tried to join, for easier access to them
- Most of the program is customizable using commands or by modifying config.py
- Check for multiple user statuses at the same time

# How do I build this from source?
There is a build script in ./build/ that can be used to build RoSniper for macOS.
This creates an executable that anyone (even if they don't have Python) can run.

Tested on macOS 15.1/15.2b2 with Python 3.13!
Windows support coming soonâ„¢
