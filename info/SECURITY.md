## Reporting a Vulnerability
Report vulnerabilities at [the issue page](https://github.com/introvertednoob/RoSniper/issues).

I will do my best to fix vulnerabilities depending on the version of RoSniper.</br>
RoSniper version 1.0.0+ (the current version) will get fixes ASAP.</br>
**Any versions prior to 1.0.0 will not get fixes. Please update your copy of RoSniper.**
